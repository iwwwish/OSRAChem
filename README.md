OSRAChem
========

OSRAChem is an open source desktop application for automated extraction and visualization of chemical structures from scientific articles (in PDF format). Structures can also be extracted from images depicting structures. All the image file [formats](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/formats.html) supported by [GraphicsMagick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/) are valid input formats.

1. Extensions:

	a. Integrate a compound library such as PubChem/ChemSpider/ChEBI/ChEMBL at the backend to identify the compounds identical/similar to the structures identified by OSRAChem from a document. This can be done by indexing the library of structures with corresponding identifiers and InChIKeys to facilitate rapid screening.
	b. add command line utilities
	c. add batch processing workflow (Fork/Join)

2. Improvements:

	a. Integrate a molecule editing environment that helps users to dynamically edit the structure and make changes to the recognized structures.
	b. Enable a 3D structure view of the molecule
	c. Upgrade the image rendering tool to a commercial version (e.g. Marvin Sketch)

3. Workflow:

	a. add R group extraction algorithm
	b. add confidence estimates to output structures
	c. add visual debug mode (in a separate panel)

4. Changes:

	a. leave out CDK dependency and use openbabel for format interconversion and I/O
	b. splash screen
	c. look and feel
